<br>This is the introductory video of the Quantum Computing playlist which explains the need for quantum computing and its foundational principles.

[2. Representing a qubit](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/tree/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit)

<br>Dirac Notation also know as Bra-Ket Notation explains how qubits are represented as state vectors in superposition and how they can be manipulated mathematically just like vectors in hilbert space. The concept is explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53EVUDbeVsU&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=2).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2.2 Bloch Sphere](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/blob/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit/2.%20Bloch%20Sphere.pdf)
<br>Bloch Sphere is the visual representation of a qubit, and is further elucidated upon in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITVHGYFIfU&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=4).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2.3 Representing a qubit using Qiskit](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/blob/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit/3.%20representing_qubit_states.ipynb)
