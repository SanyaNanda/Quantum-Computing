<br>This is the introductory video of our Quantum Computing playlist which explains the need for quantum computing and its foundational principles.

[2. Representing a qubit](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/tree/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2.1 Dirac Notation](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/blob/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit/Dirac%20Notation%20(Bra-Ket%20Notation).pdf)
<br>Dirac Notation also know as Bra-Ket Notation explains how qubits are represented as state vectors in superposition and how they can be manipulated mathematically just like vectors in hilbert space. The concept is explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53EVUDbeVsU&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=2).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2.2 Bloch Sphere](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/blob/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit/Bloch%20Sphere.pdf)
<br>Bloch Sphere is the visual representation of a qubit, and is further elucidated upon in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITVHGYFIfU&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=4).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2.3 Representing a qubit using Qiskit](https://github.com/developer-student-club-thapar/Quantum-Computing/blob/main/1.%20Representing%20a%20qubit/representing_qubit_states.ipynb)
<br>In this jupyer notebook, qubit is created as a dirac notation and represented on the bloch sphere using qiskit. Qiskit is a software development kit created by IBM for Quantum Computing. The code is explained in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sz9I2p328E&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=5).

<br>This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7paU9FX5nw&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=6&t=3s) explains the 6 ground rules that are followed to represent, transform, and measure qubits. It also allows us to calculate the probability of a qubit to be in a given state, once measured. It tells us how a qubit gets transformed over a period of time, by the application of multiple operators.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3.2 Stern Gerlach Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWaNjJ69XEI&list=PLY6CWF3NWYvTducILRZCATDwW9DjZvumJ&index=3)

<br>All the single qubit gates discussed so far, are created using the U Gate also known as the Universal gate which can be parameterised to form any gate, using angles on the bloch sphere. Interesting relations between gates are studied, which gives them the property of being clifford, all these relations are tested for equivalence using fidelity
